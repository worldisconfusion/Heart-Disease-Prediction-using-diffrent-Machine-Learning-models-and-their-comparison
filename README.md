1.	Problem statement:

The objective of this project is to develop a robust model capable of accurately predicting the presence of heart disease in patients. Given a dataset of patient health metrics, the challenge is to classify individuals into two categories: those with heart disease and those without. The focus will be on evaluating different machine learning algorithms to determine which provides the best predictive performance.
The increasing availability of electronic health records and patient-generated health data presents a unique opportunity to leverage machine learning in the fight against heart disease. By analyzing patterns within this extensive dataset, we can uncover hidden relationships between various health indicators and the likelihood of heart disease. This project not only aims to enhance predictive accuracy but also seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk factors associated with heart disease. Ultimately, the insights gained from this model could empower healthcare providers to make more informed decisions, tailor treatment plans for individual patients, and implement preventive measures that address the specific needs of at-risk populations.

 
2.	Introduction: 

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection and intervention can significantly reduce the risk of severe outcomes. With advancements in technology, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing medical data and predicting health risks. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters.

By utilizing a comprehensive dataset that includes patient demographics, medical history, physiological measurements, and lifestyle factors, this project seeks to identify key indicators associated with heart disease. The application of machine learning techniques not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also facilitates the exploration of complex interactions among various health metrics that may contribute to disease risk. 


2.1 Motivation:

The rising prevalence of heart disease underscores the need for effective predictive tools. By utilizing machine learning, we can harness large datasets to uncover patterns and make informed predictions. This project not only aims to improve the accuracy of heart disease predictions but also seeks to contribute to public health efforts by providing a data-driven approach to prevention.

Furthermore, the integration of machine learning into cardiovascular risk assessment can facilitate personalized medicine, allowing for tailored interventions based on an individual’s unique health profile. As healthcare shifts towards more proactive and preventive models, the insights generated from this project could empower clinicians to identify high-risk patients earlier and implement targeted lifestyle modifications, screenings, and treatments. 

2.2 Objective:

•	To preprocess and analyze the heart disease patient dataset effectively.
•	To implement and compare various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
•	To evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics and identify the best-performing algorithm.
•	To achieve a high accuracy rate in predicting heart disease presence.
